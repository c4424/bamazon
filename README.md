# bamazon
In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. 
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 


1. First, you must run node bamazon.js from the terminal. This will list all the products on the database.

2. Type the ID of the beer you would like to buy.
	
3. Type the amout of 6-packs you would like to buy (if you select a quantity higher than the available quantity on stock you will get a 
message asking to change the order amount.

4. Finally it will give you the total amout due $ with a message saying "your order has been placed".

5. Lastly it will ask you if you would like to keep shopping (yes/no)

6. If you choose no, the connection will end.
